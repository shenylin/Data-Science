Information,My story is like a first day on a job. I'm trying to learn all the new task. And to obtain all the knowledge that is needed to complete the task.
Information,My story is like the second day of school. You've talked to a few of your friends the first day and made a couple friends and you feel a little bit more comfortable but you're still not sure about anything yet.
Information,"My story is, this is like your first day on a job and your boss is standing over you watching your task."
Information,"I enjoyed the puzzle games a lot more, because it was one that was on military stuff and we have a bunch of family in the military so that brought nice memories of those various people, and then the colors was easy but I thought of different, you know, things where color was involved."
Information,I play wordle and spelling bee and yeah like that.
Information,"I'm sorry but I think I've run out of stories that relate to these games. I'm not creative enough to come up with stories related to these games. There's not enough to them to really come up with a story.





"
Information,"Well, it reminded me of the time I was randomly playing slot machines and just putting inwhatever amount randomly and then pushing the spin button. It wasn’t working out very well so I decidedto change my strategy and put in so many coins at a time and see what happens with that same bet. So,that’s what I did. I pushed the balloon five times and I pay out or it popped and I made about a quartereach time, and I came up with about six bucks. I think the first time I did it I came up with about sixbucks too in some sort of random way. So I really don’t think it mattered a whole lot the approach that Igave. For the word search game, this time, I went ahead and just tried to find the easy words that I couldand then moved on to the next one. (I’m) pretty good at reading left to right and not bad up and down. It’sthe diagonal ones that really get me still. I kind of feel like my approach became less random and moresystematic as I went along these games. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it."
Information,"Well, a little while ago my daughter had to have her tonsils and adenoids removed and I wassitting in the waiting room and I was kind of anxious about the procedure. I was pretty relaxed, thought itwould go pretty well but still worried in that situation so I was sitting nervously, wondering howeverything was going, waiting for them to let us know"
Information,"Yeah I was at a brunch with my friend for her 70th birthday and there were a number of other people there, I didn’t know, and they were a couple of women were professors at U of I who wanted particularly to talk a lot about her work, translating stories about seeds. That were written in low German and translating into English. And I felt like looking for the names of clergy. Her story was interesting, but I was having a lot of trouble following it."
Information,Starting to feel pretty familiar.it's a little bit like having to sit through an explanation of something that you already understand.
Information,"It’s kind of like when you're on an airplane and the plane has landed and the fasten seatbelt light is off and so you're standing there waiting to get off the airplane. I got off the airplane.





"
Information,"Well, my story is I remember as a kid I used to make my own puzzles, search or word puzzles and have my little sisters do them so yeah we used to make them at home, and I would pass it out to my sisters and watch the puzzles I created. "
Information,"I was Feelings confident, because two of the word puzzles had to do with music styles and musical instruments and I've been a musician since the 1980s, so I was Feelings confident that I would do well on those puzzles. I usually feel confident when I'm playing video games with my friends on the playstation four because I'm pretty good at those games and I can hold my own so this was similar."
Information,Trying to figure out which direction I'm going. On a round about on the highway. Thank you. I got lost.
Information,The technology had a hard time for word search; there was a delay when you change puzzles.
Information,"So there were times I pressed it two times; I didn't get one, I got two puzzles ahead and meant to get one."
Information,"Like my father was watching and playing games.
Relief; Done; End of the school year."
Information,"I'm not sure I have a story that reminds me of this experience. Possibly when I was first learning Spanish and the whole thing seemed like a lot of confusion and it took practice and actually doing this is really not like, much like anything that I've ever. done that’s been much part of my life. "
Information,"When I was in Mexico, we used to play a game, the Spanish name I can't remember was called, Greed, and the idea was to to draw cards until you basically popped your balloon and it was a lot of fun playing with a bunch of local people and the next morning all the men got in trouble, because their wives considered it gambling."
Information,"I didn't have any real tactics on the word game, but on the on the balloons, that was... that was
an easy one to figure out. I kept finding the blue balloon and I go and I get up to 55 pumps on it
and then the other ones where they, you know, they blow up too fast, so I just started just doing
that a couple of times and taking the money then wait for the blue to show up."
Information,"Mango reminds me of trips I took with my best friend Mary. And the balloon thing, blue is my favorite color and reminds me of the water. Like I don't know"
Information,"I’m 60 something years old and I’m trying to
frame it, hopefully, they have the same reference, but it seems like they don’t."
Information," have a friend, she has a smart phone, an android, I
don’t know what you call it, s"
Information,"I’m retired, I have a lot of interests but I’m from the old school, if I can’t get the
Information from the books I have on hand, and the internet I’m more challenged by than anything else so
I can’t get everything I want so um, would it help me? "
Information,"older people like me, you know, we’re used to real
life shooting you know not games and stuff or real life situations where we have to respond to you know
something like that. S"
Information,"The word search reminded me of what I do at home, a lot, and what I did when I was growing up, because my mother, let us play any game, we wanted, as long as it was scrabble so we did a lot with words, we always read books. I've never owned a TV, so I read a lot of books. I just spent too much time on that first puzzle trying to get more words and then I  realized, I had to go faster but otherwise for that yeah word games are always fun. It's like most days I play lots of word games every day. I do scrabble, I do the puzzles in the newspaper."
Information,"Um. I think it reminded me when I was younger and I wasn't very good at finding words or creating words in scrabble or whatever game, we were playing. In this case it wouldn't let me mark the words but it just I guess it teaches patience and tolerance that things go wrong, and so there is a little server error but there's nothing I could do about it. I did my best"
Information,"I was probably irritated playing with friends and losing and not knowing that I could do better, and I just I, and I just didn't but otherwise I'm not usually a happy person, and so I just go with the flow."
Information,"I did not like the word search. It reminded me of my sister and that’s all she ever does and I never like word search. The balloon game reminds me of going to the fair and squirting water into the little ducks, the little balloon mouths that blew up. That’s it."
Information,Being lost in the woods looking for the way out. Looking up and down and sideways and up. Behind you and in front of you and never kept finding a way out.
Information,"Kind of like Sunday morning crossword puzzles with my wife. She always beats me, pressure is always on."
Information,"Once again, I was not very familiar with the words that we’re supposed to be able to find. I've never played a musical instrument, I don't read music. I really don't listen to music very often so finding those words were somewhat frustrating. I was familiar with many of them, but probably not as well as I should be anyway"
Information,"It's like playing a game with one of my grandchildren, a game at their level that's not interesting to me but has some general entertainment. It reminds me of sitting in a meeting and waiting for it to be finished."
Information,"I recently learned to play a new card game and at first all the details, you get better, as you go along, you realize where the connections are and what the rules are. For me it's easier to do that when I'm playing it as opposed to reading the rules ahead of time."
Information,Like playing miniature golf on vacation.
Information,"It was rather like a Yin and Yang. The balloon type of game seemed like, it was something that I had not very much control over. In other words, it was difficult to tell when the balloons would pop. "
Information,"There were two men. I guess, they were men. It could have been anybody. A woman, a trans. Anyway, one of them decided to go to town to the old saloon in the Wild West and gamble Now gambling to this novice was a chance to make some money, be entertained and have a good time, but after a while, while gambling, he learned that if he didn't gamble, didn't put out very much money in the bet, then the thrill was not quite what he really wanted. The other side was if he put out too much money, yeah there was a big thrill, but if he lost it was quite a let down. Eventually he would still go to town and gamble just to socialize and talk to people and would bet the same amount of money, regardless every time because the gambling had actually become boring to him. The other person likes to go and challenge themselves with new, different ways of doing things and try and find intellectually different types of enjoyment such as learning Greek or flying an airplane. All of these seemed to be like a puzzle to him, that had some type of challenging intellectual gratification. He kept it up, or she or it kept it up for quite a long time because it provided stimulation and encouraged them to continue."
Information,"Ah yes, so it was a beautiful day in July when we took a birthday party balloon ride. I was 105 years old, at the time and now being a mere hundred and 112 seems like such a long time ago. We packed together, the family, in a large basket on the hot air balloon and took a beautiful ride high above the French Riviera gliding along and looking at all the people bathing down below in the Mediterranean. The seaside resort. The people having fun. Remembering, the joys of our family together in the past. As we floated along, we noticed that that the storks were migrating and flying on their way to Switzerland. Yes, most storks must be from Switzerland or Germany and they flew beside us enjoying our company in the hot air balloon as we watch them. They were off again and finally, we were joined by another group, but this time it was the pink flamingos. Yes, I can imagine the dancing birds flapping as they go on, floating along, gliding along beside us in a large pink wave."
Information,"For the word search game, this time I went ahead and just tried to find the easy words that I could and then moved on to the next one. I’m pretty good at reading left to right and up and down. It’s the diagonal ones they really get me still. So kind of like my approach became less random and more systematic as I went along these games. That’s my story and I'm sticking to it."
Information,"Well. When the kids were little which had a hand pump.You had to put the balloons on that tip and then you pump that with your hand holding up with your left hand pumping with your right hand until it was full that way it was hard for the kids to grow up balloon by themselves. But having a little hand pump they can do it, and then they would hand it to me and I would tie up. That's what the first thing reminded me of."
Information,"Let's see. I'm not real technologically savvy so it reminds me of when I work on a computer and the computer is malfunctioning or doing something that is not performing the way it should, at least the way I'm expecting it to. I guess there's a little bit of frustration associated with the experience. I thought I just did in the story, that when I work with a computer and it's not working properly and I know enough about you know, whatever I'm doing on the computer to know that it should be doing what I'm expecting it to do. "
Information,"I’m reminded of what the challenges are with technology. Like when you get a new computer or, you know, any new electronic device that or anything, for that matter, that's new that you have to learn how to use it. "
Information,"Well, it was fun and you know I started to feel a little more competitive, I guess, having been through these games aa number of times. As you get more proficient at playing, doing something, you always want to continue to improve. But in relationship to like game play, playing games, which is my best example regarding this, is that you want to do better than you did the last time so you try a little harder and you become competitive, especially with this being that I'm not playing against somebody, I’m playing against the computer to see how well I can do against my prior performance."
Information,"I like to play the word search and find puzzles. I have a book at home actually, "
Information,"It reminds me of playing these games with my grandchildren who love word games and puzzles and stuff like that. Just Feelings relaxed, because I like to play games"
Information,"I like playing games, because it keeps me moving, keeps my mind moving. Nothing comes to mind."
Information,"I’m learning what you want, and balloon pump is pure luck for how many times you pump it before they pop. And somebody tired the fireplace on. Just pretty normal. I like doing this kind of puzzle. "
Information,"I don’t know what happened the last time, but I'm just a little bit frustrated because I'm usually really good at word searches and a couple of those screens were very difficult and I'm a very competitive person, so it made me frustrated that I didn't find as many as I thought I should."
Information,"It was encouraging when I started the word search again because the topic was clergy members and my father was a minister, so I knew lots of those words to look for easily. I felt like I did pretty well so I just kind of take it and move on"
Information,Either doing word search mostly I do sudoku and other games in the paper.
Information,"I know my wife, I like to play Carcassonne and Remy every night and carcassonne on Saturday evening. "
Information,Carcassonne is a European tile game.
Information,"My wife, at both games, is a very good adversary, and I look so forward to playing with her."
Information,"We have a wonderful view in our backyard and I like to sit out there. A lots of the times I’ll just go out and just kind of meditate and many, many times just listen. "
Information,"The balloon one's getting to be hectic, to say the least. You know you can go 50 pretty safely on that one, but it’s sort of boring. And word search still fun. So I noticed that some of the words that I’ve seen there are not registering. Even though I'm pretty sure shirt and shorts are articles of clothing. Oh, I don’t know I suppose that I guess i'm thinking about the word search some things that aren't quite working right so that's a little bit annoying."
Information,"Um, it’s like walking into a room and you don’t, that you know there’s something you need to find there and you’re not sure where to begin. You’re searching and searching, you get frustrated when you go to the left, look at items there and it’s not what you’re looking for. You turn to the right and you go over there and you’re looking, you go around the peripheral of the room thinking you understand the pattern, and then you go back to the center of the room saying"
Information,"Um, I can’t really explain it, um. Uh, as far as something similar this is one of the few, well, I guess it goes with anything that you do in life, um, going to the grocery store or doing any type of task when you think you understand what you’re doing, um, go to the store looking for a particular item you go down the um, the aisle, you think it was there it’s not there and you’re saying to yourself, “Did I miss remember? Did the store move it?” something like that. Okay that’s the end of that story. What else Rava?"
Information,"And so either you muddle through or you go all the way back to the beginning and hopefully you’re thinking you remember the sequence as it should be, and you’re trying to inject but at the same time you’re still injecting from memory what you learned before."
Information,"I haven’t had to go through something like this in a while, no I take that back. When I’m explaining something to someone talking about today’s events, and they don’t seem to get it. I’m using references, I’m 60 something years old and I’m trying to frame it, hopefully, they have the same reference, but it seems like they don’t."
Information,"Well that’s kind of hard to answer that question because primarily, those devices have, if you have a lot of friends and stuff like that or you have a family, or extended family, or a large group of friends, I don’t, so I’m basically by myself except for my friend. "
Information,"Me? A. I’m retired, I have a lot of interests but I’m from the old school, if I can’t get the Information from the books I have on hand, and the internet I’m more challenged by than anything else so I can’t get everything I want so um, would it help me? Not necessarily, but, that’s another thing."
Information,"Affordability, you have to have internet access and afford the access, and if you don’t have the money for the higher end, whatever it is, 50, 60 dollars a month whatever internet you got, then with the device itself, and then adding that on to your bill, I have limited income so I mean only if I could get it at a very good price, I’d get the training the people that can help me understand, make me comfortable with it so that I could use it, you know, for whatever, that’d be one thing. But if it I had to do it on my own out of pocket, period, no, not something I’d."
Information,"But the balloon thing the main strategy there was, you anticipate it, you’re looking for when the computer’s going to switch up. If it sees me going at a, using a particular strategy I’m gonna hit three or two times something like that and then pump it and see how much money I got and then you’d repeat that and then well you better stop on that track you know so you strategize more with that balloon because you don’t want to pop it at the same time, I wanna see how much money I can get. So it’s just a matter of, not over, I mean you can use a certain strategy but you definitely can’t just stick with one you have to adapt, otherwise you blow up everytime and you don’t make no money."
Information,"basically you just guessing. You guess and you had a safe zone, for me it was like three pumps, give or take, and then after that three pumps then you do it for a series maybe three or four times in a row maybe and then if you hit it once or twice and then that’s when you said it was already full you say alright well okay"
