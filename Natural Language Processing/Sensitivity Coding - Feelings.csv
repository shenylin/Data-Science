Feelings,"I was Feelings, I'm Feelings a little stressed, because I want to do well. But a good one, a good stressed, because it was challenging."
Feelings,"I felt a little frustrated during the balloon game because too many of them popped on the first pop, on the first fill and so that was kind of frustrating."
Feelings,"I guess playing the games, while the doctor is watching on, made me think of playing the games at home or at school and, like my students watching me or my husband watching me and wanting to do good or well. I guess pride, I felt proud."
Feelings,It was fun and relaxing playing the games. I was having fun.
Feelings,"Little bit of anxiety. I don't remember the exact last time that I felt this, but there were some anxiousness."
Feelings,"My story is like when you're having a good day at work, but then the computers go down and then it gets very frustrating"
Feelings,"It reminds me of playing games when I was younger when computers first came out.
And you have to kind of figure exactly how it worked. The word search was a pain."
Feelings,"I was Feelings like I wanted to experiment in the balloon game, to see how big I can make the blue balloon, how close I could get it without popping it. "
Feelings,"It kind of reminded me of working on a computer when it's frustrating because it doesn't do quite what you had in mind, because neither my finger nor the stylus seem to be picking up the words consistently and so it's sort of like when you do something on a computer that you think is the right action, but the computer isn't responding in the way that you anticipated."
Feelings,"It was a little bit similar to learning to play the piano as an adult where sometimes you felt a sense of mastery and other times you just felt frustrated.
"
Feelings,"On the secondpuzzle, it was more challenging, it was harder to find the words, so it was a little bit frustrating. I didn’treally have a super good “story story” about it, but it’s kind of, it made me feel kind of uncertain after a while as I was finding all the words and made me wonder if I was doing it correctly, but it was actuallyjust kind of fun to push the buttons.
"
Feelings,"So it felt pretty good, pretty normal to keep asking for cards until I reached a certain amount, and then I stopped. So it actuallyfelt pretty good. I’m finished"
Feelings,"Well, a little while ago my daughter had to have her tonsils and adenoids removed and I wassitting in the waiting room and I was kind of anxious about the procedure. I was pretty relaxed, thought itwould go pretty well but still worried in that situation so I was sitting nervously, wondering howeverything was going, waiting for them to let us know"
Feelings,"And after a while time started going by, we gotgood news, everything was going fine. I just had to wait for everything with recovery and then it got kindof boring waiting there so just sitting there, wasn’t nervous anymore. "
Feelings," I was just Feelings a little anxiousabout being stuck in one place for so long, just a little bored. So then I just had to sit there and wait it out.Eventually, it got to the end of it and we went home, and she made a full recovery and she’s doing muchbetter, so I felt good about the results. I’m finished."
Feelings,"A story. Well, it was confusing. It made me feel like a little kid looking at the crossword puzzles that my dad used to do; and not being able to find the words; and not really understanding why he thought they were so interesting."
Feelings,It was a little bit frustrating.
Feelings,"Well, it was like sitting at a blackjack table and just asking for cards and trying not to busteach time. And I was just trying to see how many cards i could get before I busted, so it started with just acouple new cards, then I take go ahead and take 4 cards and see how that worked and the more cards Itook, the more often I busted. But one trick I did was when I got to 18, I stopped."
Feelings,"It was getting a little monotonous.Because the balloons are so frustrating, but the word search game it's enjoyable. But it seems like I'm really having a lot of trouble going diagonally and backwards. But It was kind of fun."
Feelings,I don't know. Nothing comes to mind. I'm Feelings mildly bored or rather mildly irritated and somewhat bored. Last time I felt like this was when I was talking to someone and I wanted to be alone and I was not interested in what they were saying.
Feelings,"Anytime that I had to go to the movies when my kids were little that were totally uninteresting to me, that's how I feel now. I don't know when the last time I had this kind of Feelings was. Maybe when somebody was giving a speech that I was not interested in."
Feelings,"Often if I am sitting home bored I will turn on something on the TV even though it is not very interesting to me but it. is enough to slightly. distract my mind from how bored I am. It was really nothing to do.

"
Feelings,"When I was younger, a child, it was rewarding when I pumped up the balloon or found the words. 

"
Feelings,"When the balloon popped, I was pretty disappointed and yeah it’s fairly enjoyable. "
Feelings,"Well, it was little exciting. I was curious to know how much air that blue balloon would actually hold. It definitely seemed to be the biggest one. So I was going to try to just go until it popped but then I was worried about my total amount of money so I didn’t. And the word search was pretty hard. I guess, I would say I was challenged. So that sums it up the best. I felt challenged and you know of course you want to go for it while also not blowing it. "
Feelings,"Well, I guess, compared to the last few times and I think I'm starting to get a little bored. The balloon game doesn't seem as much fun as it did earlier. And the word search it's still okay, but again I would say I'm getting a little bored. I think boredom usually makes me want to go and do something different."
Feelings,"I’m relatively relaxed, it just reminded me of being at home in my living room and hanging out with my dog and my wife and watching TV."
Feelings,"I was Feelings confident, because two of the word puzzles had to do with music styles and musical instruments and I've been a musician since the 1980s, so I was Feelings confident that I would do well on those puzzles. I usually feel confident when I'm playing video games with my friends on the playstation four because I'm pretty good at those games and I can hold my own so this was similar."
Feelings,I felt a bit distressful and leery because I saw some lights turning on this fireplace and I was wondering if he's gonna start cranking up the heat on me to make things more difficult.
Feelings,The first two things I noticed was the fireplace went off and then I kept getting a connection error on my tablet which reminds me of how annoyed I get at home when I'm trying to watch a movie or play a game and my Internet is sketchy so it reminds me of when I’m at home and the Internet does not cooperate.
Feelings,"The balloon one did not seem to have a pattern, I thought there was a different color that would last longer, but every balloon seemed to be random. I have a Feelings of accomplishment after learning how to do the balloon game better than I did the word puzzle game.
When I finished the sudoku puzzle."
Feelings,"Accomplishment! I felt like I did better on both games.
Success in a three star force star city puzzle."
Feelings,"Repetition. That's a story that keeps on going. The same story, different parts.
Relief, end of the school year."
Feelings,I guess it reminds me of when I was trying to learn to weave and the instructions seemed confusing. I couldn't remember what happened first and what happened second. I was always glad to have people help me and I was glad when I got better at it.
Feelings,Right now I'm Feelings sort of relieved that this first round is over
Feelings,"I'm not Feelings anything particular right now. Perhaps a little bit like taking final exams, I’m not sure."
Feelings,I'm not sure how I'm Feelings. I’m just wondering what happens next.
Feelings,I’m not sure I have any particular Feelings except contributing to a research project which I'm happy to do.
Feelings,"I don't think I have any more stories. I really kind of out of words about stories at this point. I guess not really, because I'm not sure that i'm Feelings anything in particular."
Feelings,"They were fine, I was frustrated a little, because I think a couple of times in finding the word
that it didn't record it. "
Feelings,"No, I don't... nothing, nothing comes to mind now. It's sort of like trying, a task, but I couldn't
get it accomplished, I guess, the balloon thing didn't bother me at all. The word thing was sort of
hard"
Feelings,"I'm fine, I guess, a sense of accomplishment, figuring out the one thing. I like doing puzzles, I
don't know that it relates to anything in my in my real life, which I don't have any more, since I
retired."
Feelings,"[unintelligible]... I think there was one of them where I kept writing the word, but it didn't add
up in the word counter, so I figured that it wasn't going to work and I just moved on to another
puzzle, I mean that was the only, that was the only stress aspect, I think. Some of them I
did...only one or two categories where I didn’t have enough words to figure out what I was
looking for."
Feelings,"So a story about the game. Not exactly sure on a story. Um the balloon game was frustrating
because there was no clue as to how random the pops were."
Feelings,I am Feelings fine. Um I usually am Feelings fine I guess
Feelings,"It was...I’m having a hard time with this story about what it reminds me of the game. I
mean, the balloon game is still a little bit frustrating because there’s no clues as to how many pops other
than the blue will take a lot longer than the yellow."
Feelings,"Mmm probably about 10 minutes ago when I did the last round. There’s a little bit of a
challenge in the word search, but it’s the same kind of frustration at the balloon game but um slight
challenge with the word search one."
Feelings,"Whenever I try to solve a puzzle, that’s the kind of Feelings that I have. I go into the solving
mode and that’s what I’m doing, so that’s how I feel."
Feelings,"Well, the word game, I was a little frustrated because"
Feelings,"The Feelings that I felt was primarily frustration, ashamed that I didn’t know the answer to
whatever question that was before me, and then elation when I came upon the, the actual [indiscernible]
to solve the problem. And if I didn’t solve the problem then I carried that Feelings of sadness with me, so
that’s basically it, Rava."
Feelings,"So that’s, that’s frustrating
and uh but yea you want them to get it but at the same time if someone is willful and not really,"
Feelings,"w I feel, it is frustrating, it’s frustrating. That’s it Rava.
"
Feelings,"r you hit the wrong thing on that particular screen because there’s so much visual
stuff on there, everything has a meaning and that’s frustrating."
Feelings,"ven here for me, time and time again and
I still feel frustrated, anxious about uh when I get online with it. A"
Feelings,"It
just gets frustrating when you think like oh, you know, and it’s fun, and I wouldn’t mind trying it more,
you know. "
Feelings,I'm Feelings fairly relaxed.
Feelings,"There's a health issue coming up that I have to deal with, but other than that I'm pretty happy."
Feelings,"Well, it was a little frustrating, because this cursor, whatever this thing is I'm using, didn't work well, so I had to switch to my finger, and so I guess it just reminds me that everything doesn't go the way you want, and sometimes you just have to go with the flow, and so I use my finger and it worked better for the most part. "
Feelings,"I enjoy the word game, especially the one where I chose countries because I like to travel a lot and I've been in 78 different countries. My sisters had me total it this past year and I got back from Guatemala. I have several trips coming up and so I just enjoy travel and that game reminded me of travel. "
Feelings,I was very relaxed. I enjoyed the games.
Feelings,"The balloon one wasn't as fun, because sometimes one or two would pop and sometimes the very first touch would pop it so I didn't enjoy that game, but the word game was fun. I should have been faster and gone through more games, instead of trying to find more words."
Feelings,"I was probably irritated playing with friends and losing and not knowing that I could do better, and I just I, and I just didn't but otherwise I'm not usually a happy person, and so I just go with the flow."
Feelings,"Word studies reminded me of elementary school, trying to see who could do the fastest in elementary school. I’m Feelings fine, I feel relaxed and mildly entertained."
Feelings,"Popping the balloons was like stomping on balloons, making rockets go up in the air and seeing how much the children laughed. Lots of fun, people thought it was dangerous I don’t know why. The word search topic elements reminded me of college and I felt like I should have known more elements. Not a very good story."
Feelings,"I do remember I had a professor who believed that people could blow up, I always thought he was really funny. I’m Feelings a little irritated with myself because I don’t know more elements on the top of my head. Just frustrated with the game, that’s all. I play games a lot but sometimes they’re more challenging than other times."
Feelings,"I think the word search was frustrating more than anything and the balloon game was fun, it just didn’t remind me of anything."
Feelings,"It was like being in a dream, where you're lost and you’re opening doors and you're opening windows and the doors go nowhere open next door, and it goes nowhere and next one might go somewhere, but it's not going where you want to go. Kind of frustrating."
Feelings,"It’s stressful trying to find the words. It's like a test in school, you have a timing and you don’t have much time to finish it and you can't get it done, you feel stressed. Now the time is going again and I can't get any words in there. I’m not sure how to operate this machine. It's probably in a dream. A dream about not finishing my test on time. Taking a test in school,  always stressful."
Feelings,"Kind of like Sunday morning crossword puzzles with my wife. She always beats me, pressure is always on."
Feelings,I get annoyed when I can't think of the right words.
Feelings,I feel like I should be doing better.
Feelings,"I guess taking tests in school, I got stumped and couldn't figure out how to proceed. Very stressful."
Feelings,"Playing the first game was very frustrating because I don't know the names of hardly any fabrics so it's kind of like asking me to perform a task when I have no idea what the test involves. I don't know that I have a story that made me feel the same way, just a bit of frustration, so I guess when I tried to do something new that I’ve never done before and i'm not very good at it, I get very frustrated and that's the way I was trying to find fabrics."
Feelings,"It wasn't quite as frustrating as the first time because i'm a little more familiar with members of the clergy than I was with fabric, but it's still not something that i'm extremely familiar with since i'm not very religious. So it was kind of like when my father used to tell me I needed to work on whatever homework I didn't understand and figure it out for myself, rather than actually helping me with it. Kind of frustrating, but maybe I learned something from it."
Feelings,"It was not as frustrating as fabric, because I'm more familiar with the terminology of music than I am fabric but it was so frustrating simply because musical terms are not in my normal vocabulary. So I don't have a story to tell you other than I get very frustrated when I'm asked to do things that I'm not very comfortable with and I was not very comfortable finding musical words."
Feelings,"Actually I'm even more frustrated now than I was the last three times because either it wasn't explained to me very clearly or I'm very bad at taking directions but I didn't realize until this last test that I could switch to different topics of words to find. I thought when I hit the arrow at the bottom, it meant I went to the next test which was the balloon test. "
Feelings,"Once I realized that if I found that some words quickly and switch to another word puzzle, I might know those words better. I did not understand that through the first three trials so this was much more frustrating and annoying once I realized that I hadn't been following the directions correctly. So I don't know whether to blame me or blame the person who explained it to me, but I didn't do the first three correct and I apologize for that."
Feelings,It was like doing the word search puzzles books that I had when I was a child and going on vacation on a long ride in the car. Playing the balloon game was a bit frustrating like when my Internet goes out at home and I'm not in control of getting it back on.
Feelings,"Well, I found the balloon fun it's strictly a matter of luck and I play a lot of games like that, where it's if they say it's better lucky than good. I'm not sure what else to say about them, I enjoy playing games so it's fun to learn new ones."
Feelings,"I'm finding this difficult because I enjoy playing games and when I'm playing them I just kind of get into the game. I'm not really connecting it with a story of something that I've done before, except playing another game. I still don't understand the word thing some words that I find, that I know are correct, are not showing up, so I guess I could connect it to a time I felt frustrated because things didn't work exactly as I thought they should or confused because maybe I just don't understand the point."
Feelings,"The game was relaxing and made me feel like I was home, cozy. Relaxing near my fireplace, just like I am here. "
Feelings,"Well, I enjoyed the games, I think I learned a little bit more about what you're looking for."
Feelings,I don't like the balloon game it's not very relaxing for me. I had this Feelings I was probably hanging out at home playing some games.
Feelings,"It was pretty relaxing, just a little frustrating when I can't get the stylus to work all the time. Other than that, it's pretty easy. Just relaxing by the fireplace, still playing games. Cozy, comfortable."
Feelings,"It’s just like sitting in my home, in my recliner with my dog on my lap relaxing playing games that's what I like to do. I was doing that this afternoon before I came here."
Feelings,"It was like satisfaction with the word game getting all the words. More frustrated with the balloon game when they pop in that so you try to figure out how much to do it, so you will be frustrated but it was still fun."
Feelings,It felt the same as playing games with my family when there was competition involved
Feelings,It was like an adrenaline rush when you’re competing for something.
Feelings,"The word search game, made me wish I had a list to go off of. It was fun, at first, but then it got kind of challenging on the second puzzle it was more challenging it was harder to find the words so it was a little bit frustrating. I don't really have the super good story story about it but just kind of made me feel kind of uncertain after a while if was finding all the words. It made me wonder if I was doing it correctly. But it was actually, it's kind of fun to push the buttons on the balloons. "
Feelings,"The one trick I did was when I got to 18 I stopped. So it felt pretty good, pretty normal to a keep asking for cards until I reached a certain amount, and then I stopped. So it actually felt pretty good."
Feelings,"Well a little while ago my daughter had to have her tonsils and adenoids removed and sitting in the waiting room, I was kind of anxious about the procedure. I was pretty relaxed, thought it would go pretty well. But still, you know I was worried in those situations so I was there kind of sitting nervously learning how everything was going waiting for them to let us know. And after a while, time started going by and we got good news that everything is going fine."
Feelings,"I just had to wait for her recovery and then it got kind of boring waiting there so I was just sitting there I wasn't nervous anymore. I was just getting a little bit anxious about being stuck in one place so long and I was just a little bored. Then I just had to sit there and wait it out and eventually we got to the end of it and being at home, receiving full recovery and doing much better so felt good about the results."
Feelings,"Well, it's getting a bit boring, starting to feel a little repetitive. Losing games, especially, is pretty down. Trying to think of a time when I was forced to do something that I didn't really want to do, something boring.But I can't really think of anything right now. Sorry."
Feelings,"Oh, like I just said, they remind me of a fourth grade spelling test, because we used to learn the tests through doing word searches and they always made me very anxious."
Feelings,"It reminds me of being really stressful in school, taking a test. "
Feelings,"Oh, just remind me of trying to relax doing a crossword puzzle or something, and you know, you get all stressed out because you don't know what the form of word is or whatever during the word searches you just can't find it. It's supposed to be relaxing, but sometimes it's not."
Feelings,"Let's see. I'm not real technologically savvy so it reminds me of when I work on a computer and the computer is malfunctioning or doing something that is not performing the way it should, at least the way I'm expecting it to. I guess there's a little bit of frustration associated with the experience. I thought I just did in the story, that when I work with a computer and it's not working properly and I know enough about you know, whatever I'm doing on the computer to know that it should be doing what I'm expecting it to do. "
Feelings,"It was more fun than the last time just simply because I had a better understanding of how tt was going to function so it's like learning to play a game. The first time it's challenging, you don't understand the rules or how it's to be played and then after you play it once, you have a better idea and understanding of how a game is played. You're able to start to develop a strategy of how you want to play the game and compete or collaborate, depending on the nature of the game so. "
Feelings,"Well, it was fun and you know I started to feel a little more competitive, I guess, having been through these games aa number of times. As you get more proficient at playing, doing something, you always want to continue to improve. But in relationship to like game play, playing games, which is my best example regarding this, is that you want to do better than you did the last time so you try a little harder and you become competitive, especially with this being that I'm not playing against somebody, I’m playing against the computer to see how well I can do against my prior performance."
Feelings,"interesting I was looking for the words to look up because usually on those puzzles they give you the words to find within the puzzle, so that proved to be a little more challenging since I didn't know what words that was looking for. I kind of felt competitive with my self, always wanting to be better and get the answers faster."
Feelings,"These games seem to be a little more difficult in finding the words. Some of it was probably the subject was less interesting on the puzzles. This one was probably a little more frustrating than previous ones. I think last time, probably a little more frustrating. The answers didn't seem to come as easily. When you switch puzzles there's always one word that you see that you didn't see before."
Feelings,"Oh frustration, first of all, but second of all determination to understand better why what happened, happened so that I could do better next time."
Feelings,"The word game was a little frustrating, because I was finding words that would not click and turn colors. The balloon game, I was just trying to count the number of clicks to see how many I could get in each time before I would cash it in. It was not as frustrating to me as the word game was whenever I couldn't get the words to click in and the time that I felt this way is anytime I work with computers whenever they don't work I tend to feel frustrated in that way."
Feelings,"I felt a little more comfortable with the games, the second time through because I knew what I was doing this time. I don't really feel a whole lot of emotion, I’m just Feelings calm and the last time I had this Feelings was this afternoon."
Feelings,I don't really feel a whole lot of anything. I'm just trying to concentrate and focus on what I'm doing. Maybe a little bit of apprehension.
Feelings,"It was more difficult for me to concentrate on the games this time. The word games topics were not things that I was really finding many words or thinking of very many words and the balloon game, the blue balloon that I typically had been able to pump up more was popping before I got it to where I wanted it to be so it was a little more frustrating on that part. There's just more, at this point, impatience that I'm not getting better at the games and the last time I felt this way is when I tried to do tasks that are new and I don't know what i'm doing."
Feelings,"Again the balloons felt like the fair, shooting the water in and blowing up the balloons. And the word finder, a puzzle I don't particularly like reminded me of doing morning crosswords. I was relaxed."
Feelings,"It reminded me of the fairground playing the game where you shoot the water in the balloon to inflate the blooms. And then, my daily crossword puzzle and sudoku which I usually do in the mornings. Relaxed and satisfied."
Feelings,Oh It reminded me of doing my morning crosswords and that game at the fair where you blow up the balloon by shooting the water on that target. Satisfaction when I was successful.
Feelings,"When I was playing the word game, the word search reminded me of being at a baby shower. I just feel very relaxed."
Feelings,"It reminds me of playing these games with my grandchildren who love word games and puzzles and stuff like that. Just Feelings relaxed, because I like to play games"
Feelings,"The fact that I was being watched was a little intimidating. Not much comes to mind, I'm just very relaxed."
Feelings,"Trying to hurry can be frustrating, but I did start to catch on to what's going on, especially in the word search. And the balloons is well pure luck. Well just normal. Don’t know if anything is special."
Feelings,"Well just like the other times I’ve played it. The balloon thing is just pure luck on guessing and the word search, some is easier than others, just like you said. I am playing the game and I feel, just like the other two times. I’m relaxed and just playing a game."
Feelings,"What I'm Feelings is relaxed, a little frustrated that I didn't get more things done, probably last time I had this Feelings was when I was at work, trying to get something finished and I kind of ran out of time. But I knew I could find more this kind of get more done just kind of like I know I can get more done here."
Feelings,It's a little frustrating to play games when the word search and I couldn't get the words to.
Feelings,"highlight and I knew they were there, and also when I will go to the next puzzle, and it was something I had no idea about.I guess last time I kept kind of doing something and it didn't work out. I was looking for something and it's just like you keep looking for the same thing, like, I was looking for my car keys, and they were actually where I looked for in the first time. So it's kind of a frustrating Feelings of looking for something and it's right in front of you."
Feelings,"It was kind of frustrating. The word search reminded me of when I was trying to put an online order in and I couldn't get the order to go through, and I kept pushing and pushing and I’m not get through when they ask me to do the exact same thing I did before. It was like I said before, when I was trying to order something online and I kept hitting enter and it didn't work and, finally, I had enough,then it did work, kind of like on the word search before."
Feelings,"I don’t know what happened the last time, but I'm just a little bit frustrated because I'm usually really good at word searches and a couple of those screens were very difficult and I'm a very competitive person, so it made me frustrated that I didn't find as many as I thought I should."
Feelings,"It just reminded me of maybe back in school, when I knew that I should know these words and I wasn't finding them, so frustration. I just kind of note how I felt and then I move on, I don't tend to dwell on things like that."
Feelings,"I'm Feelings frustration from the word puzzle. I just couldn't find many and I tried to think of either types of birds and then try to find them, or else I tried to just look at the letters and find whatever the category was, and that was frustrating because I couldn't figure out either one, and I would say I'm frustrated. Like when I do a sudoku and I just cannot find another number to get in like maybe I've gotten a few in, and then I can't find it anymore, so I related to doing another kind of puzzle and being frustrated."
Feelings,"That one was much easier and I could see a lot of the words right away also I could think of examples to be looking for certain words so it then gave me a sense of achievement that very last one, which would be how I would feel when I would do something at work, that was a task or project or challenge so I guess that's it. Well, just today, at my office before I came, I felt this sense of achievement. I was reviewing Information and many things correlated and I could check things off the list, and so I felt a Feelings of achievement or satisfaction and that's how I would feel like I said, with the last word search so that would be it."
Feelings,"I can't really think of an example, but I felt good about this one, because I got more money, so I feel like I conquered it better, but that's all I have to say. Well I'm Feelings better because I think the puzzles, well the word puzzle was much easier, plus I got much more money on the pump. So I guess I feel a sense of accomplishment which, okay, yesterday I stayed home from work and that may things done at home and got some errands done so I would liken it to now, Feelings a sense of fulfillment or accomplishment."
Feelings,"I just thought of something, the first game with the balloons and the pump was like the, just the two times short periods of times that I've been to Las Vegas and played the slot machine, where you started earning money and you're just kind of had to guess how long you should keep going or whether you should cash out your money and that reminded me exactly of that. Oh, well, I would really relate back to when I was in Las Vegas it, but it was a lot of fun. So, I guess, I felt happy and accomplished and kind of daring."
Feelings,"On the word find, i'm not sure if I was doing something wrong or we just wasn't connecting but I know it only registered just a few words found. When I felt comfortable that I had identified letters that would make up a word on several other cases but they did not go yellow. So i'm not sure how that will turn out. I'm not sure what real Feelings that I have about the games. "
Feelings,I'm comfortable doing this just as I am comfortable study at home and reading a book or having a discussion or watching TV or some activities of that kind.
Feelings,"The balloon game was fine again. I think I found a pattern there. A little frustration with the word search game again. I don't think I found a story to tell about those but I did find several words and highlighted them when they turned green but they didn't turn yellow today so I ended up finding one word. And so it was a frustrating to find the words and try to follow the pattern, I thought was the correct idea and to not have them count. Trying to think of something that I was frustrated by. Just wasn't doing what I thought it was supposed to do.and I was trying to find something on my new car to work and I couldn’t get it to work and it was okay there wasn’t anything there I just had trouble finding the right system, the right pattern right way to make it work."
Feelings,"Again, the frustration with the word search with the words in not highlighting green and never going to yellow. It’s like any situation when something supposed to work it doesn’t work when it’s supposed to. That’s the frustration."
Feelings,"There’s still a little frustration that I couldn't get through the all words. Well it was frustration there. When you try to get something and you think you know how to make it work, and it doesn’t do that work it’s frustrating."
Feelings,"It was frustrating when my marker, when I keep the choices that I chose in the yellow so I didn't know whether it was taking those words or not. Otherwise, it was a very easy game and I do word searches all the time, so it was enlightening. I’m just Feelings a little bit restless to get on with things. And I do that often when I'm waiting on somebody else, so I can get on with something."
Feelings,"Well, I just played the balloon game, and it was frustrating because I played it three times and I have only played the word game once and I enjoy playing word games much better, so I was a little bit irritated that I couldn’t play the word games more but that's okay I'm just here for the fun of it. I was just waiting in line for something and somebody was slow but it only lasted just a little while."
Feelings,"Well, I know I'm pretty smart in some things, but there are some things I just bypass and go on to see if I know the next one, so that's how I have been in life. If something doesn't work can I go on and find the next thing to do. But I pretty much know where I'm going when I want to to go. So. I guess that's what I'm doing with the games. I felt good about myself, because I would just go on to the next thing that I can master."
Feelings,"The balloon game was interesting but I finally got a handle on what colors will pop first. The word game I enjoy more because I enjoy word searches. But there are some subjects I don't know that much about so I just go to the next one, which is how you should live your life. Something doesn't work you go on to the next thing. Oh, I don't know, I'm pretty satisfied when I can work things out, and when I do word searches if I get all the words in an hour so on the big puzzle, I am satisfied. Makes me feel like i'm still knowledgeable in many ways."
Feelings,Frustrating. Sequential. Backwards. Challenging. Clever. Focus. I felt annoyed with myself and was determined to go back and do better.
Feelings,"It reminded me of when I had a task in design school and I was supposed to put a collar on a shirt and I wound up doing it three times and the first time I got frustrated. The second time I kind of figured it out and the third time I really, really thought it out, and then I completed it. I felt pretty good."
Feelings,"It reminds me of that that game that you play where there's a sailboat it's sort of like in a, like they're a bunch of dots around it, you almost have to kind of disconnect your eyes to see it. That's the way that I felt when I started getting more on the word test. I was proud of myself."
Feelings,I was trying to remember all the parts of my grandmother's house that I grew up in and looking for things like attic and cellar and porch and it was pretty interesting. I felt fairly content
Feelings,"It was like I was at a party pumping up balloons on the pumping balloons of like a birthday party for our grandchildren. The word game would be more like I'm at school and trying to hurry up and find some words to do a crossword puzzle. Or, I could be at home doing a crossword puzzle. Well I'm a little frustrated on the crossword puzzle I didn't recognize the words. I think I was doing better on the balloons, I earn some money, so I felt okay. But I was more frustrated on the crossword puzzle because I couldn't think of the chemical names."
Feelings,"Well, sometimes it was frustrating on the crossword puzzle, I could not get the words fly and ant to show up. I tried different ways that was frustrating and upsetting. The balloon thing, sometimes I felt like I must not have hit it in the right spot to get the money to come up and so, that was a little upsetting. But I did earn some money on the balloon so that was good. I’m a little frustrated and upset try to do it again see if I can do better, I guess."
Feelings,"Well, sometimes I got a little upset on some of the words puzzles. And I got a little upset with the balloons popping but it wasn’t that bad. I still earned money on the balloons. When I was doing a crossword puzzles I just didn’t seem to think fast enough, I guess. I probably got a little upset, but I would try to continue and until I do better."
Feelings,"Well, I had trouble on the word searches, I guess, I it the puzzle too many times and it would change. So it was a little upsetting. Let's see the balloon one went okay, I think. It was all right. That's it. Just a little upset about the crosswords. I don't know what happened, the last time let's see, let me think. I just got a little frustrated, upset but got over it."
Feelings,"Well, I enjoyed the second game more than the first game, because it evolves words, instead of just randomly popping a balloon. Those kinds of games make more sense to me and are more enjoyable. I'm done."
Feelings,"The second game in particular, on certain games reminded me of when I was talking with someone and I knew that what I was saying was correct and they kept saying no, no, this is not correct. I'm not acknowledging that you are correct. As there were words in the last game and the musical instrument game, where I was putting in a word that was clearly a word, and it was not recognized so that was pretty irritating. That's all"
Feelings,"I'm not really, I don't really care how many words I'm getting. That is the way I play games so that's it. I guess it's a Feelings of doing something for a while and then getting tired of doing it and so just moving on more quickly to see what the next game holds. That's it."
Feelings,"I mean, I guess I'm just Feelings pretty neutral. I don't, I can't identify any particular situation or occurrence that seems similar. This is a bit of a bizarre experience."
Feelings,"I'm having difficulty relating life experiences to playing these two games. They're very different from each other. The balloon game is a bit frustrating. I guess perhaps like, well, I don't know. Well, I guess I'd say I'm Feelings frustrated with the line of questioning "
Feelings,"Oh it's maybe like playing with my three grandchildren. Each one likes a different type of game. The older one would like the word game. The younger two would definitely like the balloon game and they would probably attempt to pop them every time. Well, right at the moment, my sciatica is flaring up so I guess the same as every other time it flares up it gets a little uncomfortable."
Feelings,"I guess it's a little bit like trying to catch tadpoles with your hands. As soon as you think you have it, it's gone.The reflection on the water and the movement of the border sort of distort the location of the tadpole. We were splashing around in this little bitty pond, I guess you'd say and trying to catch those tadpoles with our hands and being really frustrated. And, unlike this word game I didn't get a single one. I'm Feelings relaxed. I can't recall anything happening."
Feelings,"It would have to be a story about frustration and I cannot think of one right now. I can't remember the last time I was frustrated, other than playing the game, because several words, one wouldn't take it all others took, you know, I had to try three or four times to get them to light up and so I'm frustrated."
Feelings,"The word game has been very frustrating, because it would not accept, not light up the words that should have lit up. It took several tries, and I don't have very many stories about being frustrated. I seldom do get frustrated well, sometimes I do but I can’t make a story out of it. I mean, how do you tell a story about a fedex driver that delivers something that you have been waiting for for a week, only to discover that the mailing tube was empty. This person had the nerve to leave an empty mailing tube in front of my door and I was very frustrated, to the point where I actually went to Fedex and burst into tears. I actually bawled, almost uncontrollably because of this empty mailing tube. I mean it was ridiculous, but I was so frustrated and angry. just I just cried and people saw thought I was well, never mind what they thought I don't care so anyway that is the story about my frustration."
Feelings,"Again, the word came was somewhat frustrating because it took several tries to get the proper word to light up and so I think this time it was two or three and one of them, tangerine, perfectly good fruit, definitely a fruit just would not light up so a little bit frustrated again but hey. It is a game."
Feelings,"When I was a child, and I would come across crossword puzzle books. They've always been fun. This time it was a little challenging but I always enjoyed these types of puzzles when I was a child, so it reminded me of my childhood. I'm very chill and relaxed. This happens all the time, for me, so the last time would have been I don't know sometime today, I suppose, but I feel very comfortable. I’m engaged and enjoying my time here."
Feelings,"I'm Feelings very, very relaxed. I’m Feelings very, very comfortable. These are Feelings I typically have every day. I'm Feelings a low stress rate. I look forward to more challenges with the games. So the last time I felt this way, I guess I'm really not sure like exactly this way."
Feelings,"Playing games with someone you love just adds to the enjoyment so perhaps that was the last time I felt this way, I'm guessing."
Feelings,"I would equate this experience somewhat to that in how I feel anyway, not the dynamics of this experience itself, but just how in feel. It's a really good Feelings. I enjoy it so yeah."
Feelings,"This is a nice comfortable space, these are very engaging tasks. I feel very, very mellow and very content."
Feelings,Challenging. I'm Feelings like I've just been challenged. To think a little more than I usually do.
Feelings,"I would say, I felt a little hurried, so I would say, when I was trying to get dinner ready for a dinner party and time was running out. Yes. When I was trying to get ready for a dinner party, I felt hurried. Rushed, that’s how I feel now"
Feelings,"I would say, I felt irritated when it was not working. When I was watching a movie and the cable went out and I couldn't finish the movie."
Feelings,I don't know is that a party on Saturday and there are lots of balloons and they kept flying so that was pretty funny.
Feelings,"Well, I’m relaxed. At home, with the cat just today, relax laughing because things were funny."
Feelings,"Go play with the horses and go to Atlantic city which was always a lot of fun and then we had hooks which I, like those two which now we have a Jersey mike's and that's very exciting so."
Feelings,"my Feelings calm and relaxed and, excited to go to the next game. Cause I wanna win mark. I want to get more like gambling sorry it's very bad um I don't know that's all I know."
Feelings,"Well, the word game, I was a little frustrated because I couldn't get one of the words like kept on going over another letter and that's every time I get on the Internet, and I have trouble finding something."
Feelings,"Well, the fire is going and so I'm Feelings very relaxed. What was they doing last time. Again, just sort of hanging out at home, not doing a whole lot anything but just Feelings relaxed."
Feelings,I was a little frustrated because it wouldn't take a couple of my words racquetball. I don't know I get frustrated and then I get over it.
Feelings,"A story. Oh well, I like to do the word search in the paper finding all the different words. Normally I just go through and see what words pop up and see if it matches with the list that they have. So there you go. I don’t know just waiting for something to happen. I guess I just get impatient."
Feelings,"I don’t know what to say for a story. I, like the word search a lot better. I think I got the balloon figured out now. It's just sort of repetitive doing it. The word search was fun. I’m relaxed. No idea."
Feelings,"The balloon one's getting to be hectic, to say the least. You know you can go 50 pretty safely on that one, but it’s sort of boring. And word search still fun. So I noticed that some of the words that I’ve seen there are not registering. Even though I'm pretty sure shirt and shorts are articles of clothing. Oh, I don’t know I suppose that I guess i'm thinking about the word search some things that aren't quite working right so that's a little bit annoying."
Feelings,It sort of feels like Sunday afternoon or Sunday morning. I'm just doing some silly puzzle taking up time. Just wasting time playing with the phone mostly.
Feelings,"“I don’t know what I should be looking for, but I’m gonna try it again, maybe something will pop up that I didn’t notice before.” So it’s frustrating and you feel dumb, but you want to continue, so you try to shove your frustration aside and continue, hopefully, you’ll hit upon something that can help you find what you were looking for."
Feelings,"The Feelings that I felt was primarily frustration, ashamed that I didn’t know the answer to whatever question that was before me, and then elation when I came upon the, the actual [indiscernible] to solve the problem. And if I didn’t solve the problem then I carried that Feelings of sadness with me, so that’s basically it, Rava."
Feelings,"I mean it’s just something that you want to complete but yet you’re Feelings somewhat frustrated, but you still want to continue on with it because you think it’s a worthwhile goal to at least learn the sequences because they are necessary because it is uh, the goal is to be able to do the movements and yet at the same time you’re trying to go from your conscious mind to the unconscious."
Feelings,"said it’s at the beginning of any new task you have to continue to, don’t get too frustrated, but just continue the steps and hopefully your memory will retain everything that you need to do. That’s about the closest I could say, there’s frustration there but you still know you need to – you repeat it as much as you have to until you get comfortable with it."
Feelings,"So that’s, that’s frustrating and uh but yea you want them to get it but at the same time if someone is willful and not really, I mean if I explain something to you once and it seems like you got it and then the next day you come to me with the same question as though you don’t remember what I told you before, so I think that’s about as close to how I feel, it is frustrating, it’s frustrating."
Feelings,"And hopefully if you got a good memory you can retain the old Information and you’re not worried so much about it so you can concentrate on the new stuff, so you won’t feel as frustrated and hopefully you develop some good study habits that can incorporate the new stuff, new Information that you’re gonna be exposed to. And uh as time goes on, as with everything, for the most part, things get a little better, you don’t get as frustrated you don’t feel as anxious about it, and I would say that concludes the story"
Feelings,"I’m not great with computers but um no matter what it is on the screen that you’re looking at, if I’ve done it before, with the computer you feel like you’re on a time limit, and if you don’t exactly make the right connections do the particular task on the screen quickly enough, you think you’re gonna lose what you’re looking for. Or you hit the wrong thing on that particular screen because there’s so much visual stuff on there, everything has a meaning and that’s frustrating. "
Feelings,"Even here for me, time and time again and I still feel frustrated, anxious about uh when I get online with it. And I think that’s about as close to it as ever, no matter how familiar with the task, it’s still something there that I’m not sure what’s going on. And that concludes the story"
Feelings,"Um, comfortable, put me at ease, familiar, a little dark for me, could’ve had a little more
light but it was calming, I would say I felt okay. Like my home or someone else’s home that someone
invited me into."
Feelings,"I’m still a little standoffish and I’m always wary, I mean I try to trust them but I still got my
doubts you know if something goes wrong, okay well, I expect ..."
Feelings,"I could say I’m not too crazy about those, but in this instance with the ones I was exposed to there I was able to get more than I thought I would. So, it all depends on what the word I was searching for, that related to the uh, the keyword, um, so that wasn’t too bad. "
Feelings,"If I understood, I really wasn’t that worried, it didn’t bother me at all but that balloon thing I liked that one, I could work with that. But the other thing, hmm, I didn’t care, I didn’t have to move on to another screen like I said the other ones it didn’t really help I said eh it ain’t gonna work there."
Feelings,"It just gets frustrating when you think like oh, you know, and it’s fun, and I wouldn’t mind trying it more, you know. "
Feelings,"Somewhat because I know you were listening in as I was responding to...um Rava and uh when it was asking me you know come up with a story you know and come up with how I felt about the adjectives, describe that stuff like that I knew he was listening to my answers so that was a little stressful you know. "
Feelings,"So I was trying to put it off to the side but it did add a to the stress, when I answered Rava and I was trying to make sure I understood what the question was and what the answer was, you know, that kind of thing that was one level of stressful"
