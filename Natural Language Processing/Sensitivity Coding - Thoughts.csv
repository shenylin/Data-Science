Thoughts,"So the military word search one, made me think of the time that I was in the army and was trying to recall all the different rankings."
Thoughts,"I guess playing the games, while the doctor is watching on, made me think of playing the games at home or at school and, like my students watching me or my husband watching me and wanting to do good or well. I guess pride, I felt proud."
Thoughts,"Little bit of anxiety. I don't remember the exact last time that I felt this, but there were some anxiousness."
Thoughts,"It reminds me of playing games when I was younger when computers first came out.
And you have to kind of figure exactly how it worked. The word search was a pain."
Thoughts,"It reminded me of having to figure out the balloon game, figure out which balloon you can fill up and how much and then I got over confident and one popped early. The word games I had to really search my vocabulary on some of the items and I just didn’t know much about them. Some of them I knew a lot so it was much easier to find words."
Thoughts,"And I think I figured I had to do it quickly, because when I did it slowly and wouldn’t get as many numbers, it was kind of like just a nice let's see if we can figure this out."
Thoughts,"It kind of reminded me of working on a computer when it's frustrating because it doesn't do quite what you had in mind, because neither my finger nor the stylus seem to be picking up the words consistently and so it's sort of like when you do something on a computer that you think is the right action, but the computer isn't responding in the way that you anticipated."
Thoughts,It felt sort of like playing arcade games where it's sort of amusing and bemusing but I didn't really feel like I have a stake in the outcome.
Thoughts,"It was a little bit similar to learning to play the piano as an adult where sometimes you felt a sense of mastery and other times you just felt frustrated.
"
Thoughts,"It was kind of like playing word games on my iPad. 
"
Thoughts,"I don't really have much of a story, playing word search reminded me of when I was a kid and I did word searches. The balloon one doesn't really remind me of a story other than maybe going to the zoo and seeing balloons."
Thoughts,"The story for the balloon, I feel like I’m getting this figured out I can pop up the blue balloon a lot further than the yellow or the orange, but I’m having a little trouble figuring out when the the orange or the yellow balloon pops so I’m being really risk averse but I’m being very much riskier on the blue balloon. On the word game I had a little trouble with the weapons, but the other ones I could get."
Thoughts,"I don't know if I really have a story that reminds me of playing the games right now. I'm still not getting the risk of how far I could go with the blue balloon and how far I can go with the yellow and the orange but I'm being kind of risk averse there so that's my story. The word search reminds me of sitting in a car and doing card games on trips, long vacation trips, when I was a kid we used to do the word searches."
Thoughts,"I'm sorry but I think I've run out of stories that relate to these games. I'm not creative enough to come up with stories related to these games. There's not enough to them to really come up with a story.





"
Thoughts,"Rava, a story is, the games reminded me of... Well the balloon game reminded me of tryingto throw something in the garbage can. It keeps falling out and I keep trying to throw it in and it keepsfalling out. That’s what it reminded me of when it kept popping quickly. The word search game made mewish I had a list to go off of. It was, it was fun at first, but then it got kind of challenging."
Thoughts,"Well, it reminded me of the time I was randomly playing slot machines and just putting inwhatever amount randomly and then pushing the spin button. It wasn’t working out very well so I decidedto change my strategy and put in so many coins at a time and see what happens with that same bet. So,that’s what I did. I pushed the balloon five times and I pay out or it popped and I made about a quartereach time, and I came up with about six bucks. I think the first time I did it I came up with about sixbucks too in some sort of random way. So I really don’t think it mattered a whole lot the approach that Igave. For the word search game, this time, I went ahead and just tried to find the easy words that I couldand then moved on to the next one. (I’m) pretty good at reading left to right and not bad up and down. It’sthe diagonal ones that really get me still. I kind of feel like my approach became less random and moresystematic as I went along these games. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it."
Thoughts," Well, it was like sitting at a blackjack table and just asking for cards and trying not to busteach time. And I was just trying to see how many cards i could get before I busted, so it started with just acouple new cards, then I take go ahead and take 4 cards and see how that worked and the more cards Itook, the more often I busted. But one trick I did was when I got to 18, I stopped."
Thoughts,"Because yellow and orange balloons seemed to not be able to be blown up at all and I kept wanting to, I think I did blow up at least one blue balloon but I kept thinking the blue balloons were gonna make me more money and I didn't like the yellow orange balloons at all. And I like the word search puzzles, but for some reason."
Thoughts,"Well, it was like sitting at a blackjack table and just asking for cards and trying not to busteach time. And I was just trying to see how many cards i could get before I busted, so it started with just acouple new cards, then I take go ahead and take 4 cards and see how that worked and the more cards Itook, the more often I busted. But one trick I did was when I got to 18, I stopped."
Thoughts,"Yeah I was at a brunch with my friend for her 70th birthday and there were a number of other people there, I didn’t know, and they were a couple of women were professors at U of I who wanted particularly to talk a lot about her work, translating stories about seeds. That were written in low German and translating into English. And I felt like looking for the names of clergy. Her story was interesting, but I was having a lot of trouble following it."
Thoughts,The last time I had this Feelings was the previous round of games. That's the first thing comes to mind.
Thoughts,I don't know. Nothing comes to mind. I'm Feelings mildly bored or rather mildly irritated and somewhat bored. Last time I felt like this was when I was talking to someone and I wanted to be alone and I was not interested in what they were saying.
Thoughts,"Anytime that I had to go to the movies when my kids were little that were totally uninteresting to me, that's how I feel now. I don't know when the last time I had this kind of Feelings was. Maybe when somebody was giving a speech that I was not interested in."
Thoughts,"Often if I am sitting home bored I will turn on something on the TV even though it is not very interesting to me but it. is enough to slightly. distract my mind from how bored I am. It was really nothing to do.

"
Thoughts,"When I was younger, a child, it was rewarding when I pumped up the balloon or found the words. 

"
Thoughts,"Well, it was little exciting. I was curious to know how much air that blue balloon would actually hold. It definitely seemed to be the biggest one. So I was going to try to just go until it popped but then I was worried about my total amount of money so I didn’t. And the word search was pretty hard. I guess, I would say I was challenged. So that sums it up the best. I felt challenged and you know of course you want to go for it while also not blowing it. "
Thoughts,"Well, I feel like I'm learning, because that blue balloon holds a lot more air than the other two. That kind of makes me sort of laugh when the other to break right away. "
Thoughts,"Well, I guess, compared to the last few times and I think I'm starting to get a little bored. The balloon game doesn't seem as much fun as it did earlier. And the word search it's still okay, but again I would say I'm getting a little bored. I think boredom usually makes me want to go and do something different."
Thoughts,"In the word search, some are definitely easier than others and yeah that's about it. Well I guess just you know, the challenge and trying to figure out, I’m sure there's some pattern, especially with the balloons. I haven't been able to really figure it out. I guess just the challenge and seeing if I can do it."
Thoughts,"Well, my story is I remember as a kid I used to make my own puzzles, search or word puzzles and have my little sisters do them so yeah we used to make them at home, and I would pass it out to my sisters and watch the puzzles I created. "
Thoughts,"I’m relatively relaxed, it just reminded me of being at home in my living room and hanging out with my dog and my wife and watching TV."
Thoughts,I felt a bit distressful and leery because I saw some lights turning on this fireplace and I was wondering if he's gonna start cranking up the heat on me to make things more difficult.
Thoughts,I'm not a big fan of the heat and it reminds me of a time when my step son was mad at me and I was trying to take a nap and he turned the heat way up on because he knew it would irritate me. That’s what this reminded me of.
Thoughts,The first two things I noticed was the fireplace went off and then I kept getting a connection error on my tablet which reminds me of how annoyed I get at home when I'm trying to watch a movie or play a game and my Internet is sketchy so it reminds me of when I’m at home and the Internet does not cooperate.
Thoughts,"It reminds me of rabbit hunting, when I was a kid. I knew the rabbits were there, but I couldn't find it. Thank you."
Thoughts,"Reminded me at Christmas, at my grandma's house. She didn't believe in Christmas.

"
Thoughts,"The first time I drove a race car. It wouldn't start and I missed the race. I just gave up. I didn't try it again.
"
Thoughts,"The balloon one did not seem to have a pattern, I thought there was a different color that would last longer, but every balloon seemed to be random. I have a Feelings of accomplishment after learning how to do the balloon game better than I did the word puzzle game.
When I finished the sudoku puzzle."
Thoughts,"Accomplishment! I felt like I did better on both games.
Success in a three star force star city puzzle."
Thoughts,I guess it reminds me of when I was trying to learn to weave and the instructions seemed confusing. I couldn't remember what happened first and what happened second. I was always glad to have people help me and I was glad when I got better at it.
Thoughts,And I’m not sure that this reminds me of any particular experience that I've had. Little bit like doing the crossword and not being able to figure out the last clue.
Thoughts,"Um, like the one I remember, was racquetball. The balloon ones were okay
I just sort of kept, uhm, trying not to pop them, I just kept collecting as much money as I could
along the way. That's all I have, I think"
Thoughts,"No, I don't... nothing, nothing comes to mind now. It's sort of like trying, a task, but I couldn't
get it accomplished, I guess, the balloon thing didn't bother me at all. The word thing was sort of
hard"
Thoughts,"I told you all those stories I can. Obviously, I haven't figured out yet how high I could go on
the blue balloon, but obviously 55 pumps is... if I have to do this again, I'm going to see how far
it goes till it explodes. And the one puzzle didn't seem like the words were recording so I skipped
to another puzzle. You know, a couple of them I didn't know. I didn't have enough vocabulary
to figure out all the different fuels they were looking for"
Thoughts,"I'm fine, I guess, a sense of accomplishment, figuring out the one thing. I like doing puzzles, I
don't know that it relates to anything in my in my real life, which I don't have any more, since I
retired."
Thoughts,"I didn't have any real tactics on the word game, but on the on the balloons, that was... that was
an easy one to figure out. I kept finding the blue balloon and I go and I get up to 55 pumps on it
and then the other ones where they, you know, they blow up too fast, so I just started just doing
that a couple of times and taking the money then wait for the blue to show up."
Thoughts,"you know... I just thought it was popping really fast. So I just decided I’d go for short bursts on the yellow or the orange one and the blue, and I just couldn't you know...I wish I'd kept going until I found how many times, I could pump it till it popped. I went up to 55 and that’s as far as it went."
Thoughts,"The word game was ok, but I accidentally
skipped a screen. A story? Like a fiction story or like a story of another game I played like that? I’m not
quite sure what kind of story. It’s a big prompt."
Thoughts,"Ok. Umm it was a little umm better the second time because I had done it once before and I
do think that the blue balloons will take more air than the yellow or orange so. And the word games, there
were some harder ones than the other. I don’t know what kind of story you want me to tell."
Thoughts,"Hmm. It was like playing the two games before, but I knew what I was doing now."
Thoughts,"But I can't think of a story that reminds me of playing
the game. I can describe my experience but that’s about it."
Thoughts," It was like learning how to beat other games that use random, uh, random, what’s the right
word, stimulus. That’s it."
Thoughts,"Well, I got on a bicycle once, I rode the bicycle until I fell off. I got back on and I tried to
figure out what makes me fall off; I practiced balancing and I practiced avoiding different places on the
sidewalk that might not be down, eventually I figured it out and I ride the bicycle pretty well nowadays."
Thoughts,"It was reminiscent of a time I found myself in a dark cave and I had to find my way out and I
had to find my way out. I tried this I tried that, I saw things that could be the answer, but it turns out no
that wasn’t real. And it reminds me an awful lot of this test, so, that’s how it is."
Thoughts,"Well I had set up an experiment with other students I would make deceptive things like
having someone look over your shoulder or something like that. And the students had to take the test
with this artificial irritation and so this reminds me of the test I’m taking now."
Thoughts,I don't know is that a party on Saturday and there were lots of balloons and they kept flying in everybody’s face so that was pretty funny.
Thoughts,I don't know I can't think of a story that it was like.
Thoughts,I played the flute when I was a kid.
Thoughts,I suppose I like gambling meaning in regards to when I used to go play with the horses and good Atlantic city which was always a lot of fun.
Thoughts," Like I said the more you, you have to try and, if
you’re going for speed you’re pressuring yourself so if you could relax more, you’ve been in a situation
before and realized maybe it would help you and since it’s just new"
Thoughts,"The word search reminded me of what I do at home, a lot, and what I did when I was growing up, because my mother, let us play any game, we wanted, as long as it was scrabble so we did a lot with words, we always read books. I've never owned a TV, so I read a lot of books. I just spent too much time on that first puzzle trying to get more words and then I  realized, I had to go faster but otherwise for that yeah word games are always fun. It's like most days I play lots of word games every day. I do scrabble, I do the puzzles in the newspaper."
Thoughts,"There's a health issue coming up that I have to deal with, but other than that I'm pretty happy."
Thoughts,"Well, it was a little frustrating, because this cursor, whatever this thing is I'm using, didn't work well, so I had to switch to my finger, and so I guess it just reminds me that everything doesn't go the way you want, and sometimes you just have to go with the flow, and so I use my finger and it worked better for the most part. "
Thoughts,"Not really a story, but it's, all I can think of. Yes. I was doing something similar, and what I was supposed to use didn't work, and so I just had to use something else, so I thought fine I, you know as long as there's something else I can use in its place it works all right."
Thoughts,"I enjoy the word game, especially the one where I chose countries because I like to travel a lot and I've been in 78 different countries. My sisters had me total it this past year and I got back from Guatemala. I have several trips coming up and so I just enjoy travel and that game reminded me of travel. "
Thoughts,"The balloon one wasn't as fun, because sometimes one or two would pop and sometimes the very first touch would pop it so I didn't enjoy that game, but the word game was fun. I should have been faster and gone through more games, instead of trying to find more words."
Thoughts,"Um. I think it reminded me when I was younger and I wasn't very good at finding words or creating words in scrabble or whatever game, we were playing. In this case it wouldn't let me mark the words but it just I guess it teaches patience and tolerance that things go wrong, and so there is a little server error but there's nothing I could do about it. I did my best"
Thoughts,"It reminded me of when I worked blowing up balloons, I worked in a greenhouse but for Valentine’s day we had to blow up balloons. It was a lot of fun playing with the helium and being silly with sounds. We blew up so many balloons that day. Another one about blowing up balloons, a sad one, recently a young man died and they released a bunch of mylar balloons and the power went out and we knew instantly that it was the balloon that made the power go out."
Thoughts,"Word studies reminded me of elementary school, trying to see who could do the fastest in elementary school. I’m Feelings fine, I feel relaxed and mildly entertained."
Thoughts,"Popping the balloons was like stomping on balloons, making rockets go up in the air and seeing how much the children laughed. Lots of fun, people thought it was dangerous I don’t know why. The word search topic elements reminded me of college and I felt like I should have known more elements. Not a very good story."
Thoughts,"I do remember I had a professor who believed that people could blow up, I always thought he was really funny. I’m Feelings a little irritated with myself because I don’t know more elements on the top of my head. Just frustrated with the game, that’s all. I play games a lot but sometimes they’re more challenging than other times."
Thoughts,"Well, I felt like I was at a traffic jam in the big city and I knew I could go, I could see where I could go, but I couldn’t quite make it, just kind of stuck. Reminded me of work when there was a project and I couldn’t get myself focused enough to finish it."
Thoughts,"I did not like the word search. It reminded me of my sister and that’s all she ever does and I never like word search. The balloon game reminds me of going to the fair and squirting water into the little ducks, the little balloon mouths that blew up. That’s it."
Thoughts,"Same thing. The balloon one I thought about going to the fair and playing those balloons and on the word search I, when it was the buildings I was thinking about my house."
Thoughts,"When I played the balloon game, I thought about filling up, blowing up birthday balloons with my grandson. On the word search, I wasn’t really thinking of anything, just trying to find the words."
Thoughts,"Driving over here, I had the directions in my mind, of how to get here and I had it planned out, and when I got here I couldn't find what I thought was there, so I was looking for particular words, and I think they would be there and they would not be there that's what it reminds me of is driving and not getting to your destination."
Thoughts,"It actually reminded me of the kind of dream, you have where you can't ever end anything you keep going and going and going like a road that never ends. A bad situation that never ends."
Thoughts,"It was like being in a dream, where you're lost and you’re opening doors and you're opening windows and the doors go nowhere open next door, and it goes nowhere and next one might go somewhere, but it's not going where you want to go. Kind of frustrating."
Thoughts,I can’t think of anything just like it that I’ve ever experienced. I’m on the word game for fuel now. Back in school taking a test I think.
Thoughts,Nothing quite compares to that. I guess once again doing crosswords with my wife. She's really good at these games and I'm not.
Thoughts,"Once I realized that if I found that some words quickly and switch to another word puzzle, I might know those words better. I did not understand that through the first three trials so this was much more frustrating and annoying once I realized that I hadn't been following the directions correctly. So I don't know whether to blame me or blame the person who explained it to me, but I didn't do the first three correct and I apologize for that."
Thoughts,It was like doing the word search puzzles books that I had when I was a child and going on vacation on a long ride in the car. Playing the balloon game was a bit frustrating like when my Internet goes out at home and I'm not in control of getting it back on.
Thoughts,I feel like it's like when the airplane has landed and I'm waiting for my turn to get off and go on to do my next thing. I feel like at the end of a work day for me that's volunteering right now. When I have accomplished a task that was good to do but it didn't have a big impact on anything.
Thoughts,It was like completing tasks at the end of a workday. Knowing it's the end and I get to move on. I just finished the end of a volunteer shift at where I work and I feel like I am at the end of a work period and I’m glad to be near the end.
Thoughts,Well it's reminiscent of learning to play any new game
Thoughts,"I recently learned to play a new card game and at first all the details, you get better, as you go along, you realize where the connections are and what the rules are.  For me it's easier to do that when I'm playing it as opposed to reading the rules ahead of time."
Thoughts,"Well, I found the balloon fun it's strictly a matter of luck and I play a lot of games like that, where it's if they say it's better lucky than good. I'm not sure what else to say about them, I enjoy playing games so it's fun to learn new ones."
Thoughts,"It reminds me of some of the games that I play online. I often will try a new one, and sometimes I don't understand the point of it, so it takes me a while to figure out strategy. So I think any game that you play you sort of do that. I like to just throw myself in it and start playing and then figure it out. I'm not very good at reading the rules."
Thoughts,"Well, I enjoyed the games, I think I learned a little bit more about what you're looking for."
Thoughts,"Probably when I used to watch one of my daughters playing basketball and the anxiety, you know, trying to you know, make the basket or something so you're trying not to pop the balloon and as far as the word game just you know, just watching how things progress I guess. You know have to like watch my daughter play softball or whatever, she was always good at it so."
Thoughts,"Again, just like watching a competition, one of my kids playing ball or or my granddaughter dancing or something. Just get real high when you think you're going to win and things like that."
Thoughts,Playing cards while we’re on vacation and trying to beat each other.
Thoughts,"Once upon a time, long ago when I was but a wee boy I remember my brother and I by the banks of the big ditch in Montana right outside the farmhouse. And near the bridge, little wooden bridge crossing the big ditch, between two pastures was an area, a sandy type of area rather flat, very rocky because many rocks. It was rocky mountains, on which the cattle would cross. On the sandy area, we would take and build a whole farm type area with little fences, telephone poles, wires, little houses made from branches and pieces of rocks and other assortments and things we would string and things we collect from the house. It was a wonderful time. Joy with intense focus. Yet a calm joy, calm focused."
Thoughts,So to me that was more of a game of unknown and a game of chance without very much ability to use your cognitive powers. The other one seemed more of the Yang. More of a Feelings that I had more control over the particular game and could use focus and use my power of observation and cognitive skills.
Thoughts,"The story is the games reminded me of, well the balloon game reminded me of, trying to throw something in the garbage can and it keeps falling out and I keep having to throw it in and it keeps falling out. That is what I was reminded of when they kept popping quickly."
Thoughts,"I don't really have the super good story story about it but just kind of made me feel kind of uncertain after a while if was finding all the words. It made me wonder if I was doing it correctly. But it was actually, it's kind of fun to push the buttons on the balloons."
Thoughts,"Well, it reminds me of the time that I was randomly playing slot machines and just putting in whatever amount randomly and then pushing the spin button. It wasn’t working out very well, so I decided to change my strategy and just put in so many coins at a time and just see what happens with that same bet. "
Thoughts,"So that's what I did, I pushed the balloon five times and I take my pay out or it popped. Either way, I made about a quarter each time and came up with about six bucks. I think the first time I did it came up with about six bucks too, in some sort of random way, so I really don’t think it mattered a whole lot, the approach for that game."
Thoughts,"Well, it was like sitting at the blackjack table and just asking for cards and trying to bust it each time. And I was just trying to see how many cards I could get before I busted. It started with just a couple, two cards and then I thought I would take four cards and see how that works and the more cards I took the more often I busted. "
Thoughts,"Well, I guess doing the word searches took me back to when I was a kid, those are like first word puzzles that I can do. Commonly like books, they would give you the answers, so that you can always check out if you got them all or not. The easiest ones to find for me are those to stick out the circles in the grid. But I've graduated from word searches to more difficult puzzles like crossword puzzles.They really don't do word searches anymore unless i'm really bored and nothing better than that."
Thoughts,"I don't know this reminds me of kind of losing yourself and doing some puzzles and games, or something like that. I sometimes feel that way when I'm doing some drawing. You kind of just focus on what you're doing."
Thoughts,"Oh, like I just said, they remind me of a fourth grade spelling test, because we used to learn the tests through doing word searches and they always made me very anxious."
Thoughts,"It reminds me of being really stressful in school, taking a test. "
Thoughts,"Oh gosh. It’s like getting lost on a road, I guess is the way I would describe it. You know you went into all these different parts and these words, and I have no idea of the price of building or chemical elements, so it's kind of lost, like where to go or what you're looking for."
Thoughts,"Oh, just remind me of trying to relax doing a crossword puzzle or something, and you know, you get all stressed out because you don't know what the form of word is or whatever during the word searches you just can't find it. It's supposed to be relaxing, but sometimes it's not."
Thoughts,"Let's see. I'm not real technologically savvy so it reminds me of when I work on a computer and the computer is malfunctioning or doing something that is not performing the way it should, at least the way I'm expecting it to. I guess there's a little bit of frustration associated with the experience. I thought I just did in the story, that when I work with a computer and it's not working properly and I know enough about you know, whatever I'm doing on the computer to know that it should be doing what I'm expecting it to do. "
Thoughts,"It was fun. I'm not a big fisherman so I got a slow start on the puzzle. The balloon one was fun, because you never knew when it was going to pop. That seemed a little strategic."
Thoughts,"I think that I was reminded in the second round that the objective was to get as many words as possible and so I moved through the puzzles quicker. When I wasn't finding words as quickly, then I just went on to the next one. And that’s unlike me, because I like to finish what I’ve started, but it was fun. I think, like I said before, I have a competitive spirit so I think of fun games. We were just playing bags this weekend and you know the time element adds a different dimension to it, when you're up against the clock."
Thoughts,"These games seem to be a little more difficult in finding the words. Some of it was probably the subject was less interesting on the puzzles. This one was probably a little more frustrating than previous ones. I think last time, probably a little more frustrating. The answers didn't seem to come as easily. When you switch puzzles there's always one word that you see that you didn't see before."
Thoughts,"The word game was a little because I got a server error three times. Also, found the word fly from the insect puzzle but it wouldn't highlight. I think in general when I feel like that I try to find solutions to the problems or seek assistance. So like a server error or something like that I would try to find out why."
Thoughts,"Well, I think for the first game I can't think of specifics, but. Just times, where you're doing something that you think you know how to do well, and then some aspect of it changes and you don't really expect it so it's like you're doing something that you’ve done for a while and all sudden you don't succeed at it for reasons that are completely new to you, so the balloon game kind of reminded me of that. Oh frustration, first of all, but second of all determination to understand better why what happened, happened so that I could do better next time."
Thoughts,"Well, this time I think more about the word search game. Again, not a specific time but I suppose a time when I felt like I ought to know more of something than I actually did."
Thoughts,"I really thought I would have known more of the words in a certain category and it almost made me feel, it reminded me of times when you oughta know something but you just can't recall it. Probably frustrated with myself that I couldn't remember the things that I wanted to, but critical of myself."
Thoughts,"I’m thinking of times when I’m trying to figure out something and I feel like I'm needing more Information to really figure out what it is I'm dealing with and I'm not given enough opportunities to try out different things before having gone on to something else. Determination, wanting to keep trying."
Thoughts,Same thing goes. I think I report times when I am trying to analyze and be more methodical about how we're approaching something and still not quite seeing all the pieces and how they fit together and how something's working.
Thoughts,"The word game was simpler whenever I had topics that I understood or new more words for. The bubble game, I was not paying enough attention, I was popping more balloons than I had done in previous games"
Thoughts,"It was more difficult for me to concentrate on the games this time. The word games topics were not things that I was really finding many words or thinking of very many words and the balloon game, the blue balloon that I typically had been able to pump up more was popping before I got it to where I wanted it to be so it was a little more frustrating on that part. There's just more, at this point, impatience that I'm not getting better at the games and the last time I felt this way is when I tried to do tasks that are new and I don't know what i'm doing."
Thoughts,"The first game, it reminds me of a game I played as a child. Similar to busting the balloons and it also reminds me of the fair where you shoot the water stream in and blow up the balloons. The word find reminded me of the crossword puzzle I do daily."
Thoughts,"Again the balloons felt like the fair, shooting the water in and blowing up the balloons. And the word finder, a puzzle I don't particularly like reminded me of doing morning crosswords. I was relaxed."
Thoughts,"It reminded me of the fairground playing the game where you shoot the water in the balloon to inflate the blooms. And then, my daily crossword puzzle and sudoku which I usually do in the mornings. Relaxed and satisfied."
Thoughts,Oh It reminded me of doing my morning crosswords and that game at the fair where you blow up the balloon by shooting the water on that target. Satisfaction when I was successful.
Thoughts,"When I was playing the word game, the word search reminded me of being at a baby shower. I just feel very relaxed."
Thoughts,"It reminds me of playing these games with my grandchildren who love word games and puzzles and stuff like that. Just Feelings relaxed, because I like to play games"
Thoughts,"Trying to hurry can be frustrating, but I did start to catch on to what's going on, especially in the word search. And the balloons is well pure luck. Well just normal. Don’t know if anything is special."
Thoughts,"I’m learning what you want, and balloon pump is pure luck for how many times you pump it before they pop. And somebody tired the fireplace on. Just pretty normal. I like doing this kind of puzzle. "
Thoughts,"Well just like the other times I’ve played it. The balloon thing is just pure luck on guessing and the word search, some is easier than others, just like you said. I am playing the game and I feel, just like the other two times. I’m relaxed and just playing a game."
Thoughts,About the same as the other times. I'm starting to learn the word thing better and well the balloon thing is pretty much random and it’s interesting watching seeing how many times you turn the fireplace on and off. I am just playing this game.
Thoughts,"Well, it was kind of fun to play the two games right now. It reminded me of being in grade school and I teach second grade, so it kind of reminds me of some of the tasks my kids have to do."
Thoughts,"highlight and I knew they were there, and also when I will go to the next puzzle, and it was something I had no idea about.I guess last time I kept kind of doing something and it didn't work out. I was looking for something and it's just like you keep looking for the same thing, like, I was looking for my car keys, and they were actually where I looked for in the first time. So it's kind of a frustrating Feelings of looking for something and it's right in front of you."
Thoughts,"I just felt like quitting at the end, I was tired of playing and I wasn't doing very well and I just meant to be over. The last time I had this kind of Feelings I think I was playing video games with my nephew and I wasn't doing very well, so I just quit, he was much better than me."
Thoughts,"When I was playing the word search game, it reminded me of being a kid at my grandma's house because I used to play word search at her house a lot. And when I was playing the balloon game it reminded me of being in Vegas, being a risk taker or not with slot machines and such. "
Thoughts,"It reminds me the story that reminds me about being an only child that I would play word searches, because I didn't have another sibling to play with games with like in the car or if you're on vacation like in a cabin. So I guess just the whole doing this, these games reminds me of being an only child and trying to entertain myself. I probably just tried to realize why I was frustrated and then I kind of just move on."
Thoughts,"It was encouraging when I started the word search again because the topic was clergy members and my father was a minister, so I knew lots of those words to look for easily. I felt like I did pretty well so I just kind of take it and move on"
Thoughts,"It just reminded me of maybe back in school, when I knew that I should know these words and I wasn't finding them, so frustration. I just kind of note how I felt and then I move on, I don't tend to dwell on things like that."
Thoughts,"Well, I guess it reminds me of me trying to do puzzles at home, particularly word puzzles. I've tried to do those up and on Sundays when I do a sudoku or tried to do a crossword or jumble so the one word search reminded me of that, trying to find the answer and get it marked in. I really can't think of an experience that reminds me, or story, that reminds me about the pumping. So that's about all I have to say."
Thoughts,"I don't know that I have any story that would be different than what I said for the previous two games. I'd have to think of a story that was somewhat frustrating, which relates back to just doing puzzles or figuring things out and a story that would have some achievement. When I work, if I can figure something out somewhat quickly, say a task that I'm working on at work, that would make me feel to some degree, like the word puzzle, the last one that was vegetables."
Thoughts,"That one was much easier and I could see a lot of the words right away also I could think of examples to be looking for certain words so it then gave me a sense of achievement that very last one, which would be how I would feel when I would do something at work, that was a task or project or challenge so I guess that's it. Well, just today, at my office before I came, I felt this sense of achievement. I was reviewing Information and many things correlated and I could check things off the list, and so I felt a Feelings of achievement or satisfaction and that's how I would feel like I said, with the last word search so that would be it."
Thoughts,"I only played one game. I just play the balloon game but I'm trying to think what I've done that it's kind of like the balloon game where you kind of have to. figure out logically or tried for that, logically, which balloon you could get the most money from. I mean to me it was obvious in the three games that the blue one was the most money. I'm trying to think of a story that, something I've done, already kind of have to figure out how that's gonna work. I can't really think of an example, but I felt good about this one, because I got more money, so I feel like I conquered it better, but that's all I have to say."
Thoughts,"I just thought of something, the first game with the balloons and the pump was like the, just the two times short periods of times that I've been to Las Vegas and played the slot machine, where you started earning money and you're just kind of had to guess how long you should keep going or whether you should cash out your money and that reminded me exactly of that. Oh, well, I would really relate back to when I was in Las Vegas it, but it was a lot of fun. So, I guess, I felt happy and accomplished and kind of daring."
Thoughts,"The game was interesting, I think I found a pattern on it very quickly that seemed to work on most of the times, after that, before stopping before the balloon popped. "
Thoughts,The games are clearly identified and explained.
Thoughts,"The balloon game was fine again. I think I found a pattern there. A little frustration with the word search game again. I don't think I found a story to tell about those but I did find several words and highlighted them when they turned green but they didn't turn yellow today so I ended up finding one word. And so it was a frustrating to find the words and try to follow the pattern, I thought was the correct idea and to not have them count. Trying to think of something that I was frustrated by. Just wasn't doing what I thought it was supposed to do.and I was trying to find something on my new car to work and I couldn’t get it to work and it was okay there wasn’t anything there I just had trouble finding the right system, the right pattern right way to make it work."
Thoughts,"It was really the same situation as the last set where the balloon game was setting a pattern, and then, following that pattern to maximize the time between the activity and balloon popping. For the second game I should be finding no words, which really wasn't the case but, either i'm doing something wrong or there is no function somewhere. "
Thoughts,"Not much different than the others. The balloon game was fine. I pushed it a little bit more than I did before so but it was was fine and. Like most experiences, like a lot of experiences in life, it was okay. The word game was a little better, at least I highlighted it right this time."
Thoughts,"Well, I know I'm pretty smart in some things, but there are some things I just bypass and go on to see if I know the next one, so that's how I have been in life. If something doesn't work can I go on and find the next thing to do. But I pretty much know where I'm going when I want to to go. So. I guess that's what I'm doing with the games. I felt good about myself, because I would just go on to the next thing that I can master."
Thoughts,"The balloon game was interesting but I finally got a handle on what colors will pop first. The word game I enjoy more because I enjoy word searches. But there are some subjects I don't know that much about so I just go to the next one, which is how you should live your life. Something doesn't work you go on to the next thing. Oh, I don't know, I'm pretty satisfied when I can work things out, and when I do word searches if I get all the words in an hour so on the big puzzle, I am satisfied. Makes me feel like i'm still knowledgeable in many ways."
Thoughts,"It reminded me of when I had a task in design school and I was supposed to put a collar on a shirt and I wound up doing it three times and the first time I got frustrated. The second time I kind of figured it out and the third time I really, really thought it out, and then I completed it. I felt pretty good."
Thoughts,"It reminds me of that that game that you play where there's a sailboat it's sort of like in a, like they're a bunch of dots around it, you almost have to kind of disconnect your eyes to see it. That's the way that I felt when I started getting more on the word test. I was proud of myself."
Thoughts,I was trying to remember all the parts of my grandmother's house that I grew up in and looking for things like attic and cellar and porch and it was pretty interesting. I felt fairly content
Thoughts,"It was like I was at a party pumping up balloons on the pumping balloons of like a birthday party for our grandchildren. The word game would be more like I'm at school and trying to hurry up and find some words to do a crossword puzzle. Or, I could be at home doing a crossword puzzle. Well I'm a little frustrated on the crossword puzzle I didn't recognize the words. I think I was doing better on the balloons, I earn some money, so I felt okay. But I was more frustrated on the crossword puzzle because I couldn't think of the chemical names."
Thoughts,"Probably when I was playing a scrabble game and I knew that there were more answers there, but I wasn't able to see them quickly. That's it."
Thoughts,"The second game in particular, on certain games reminded me of when I was talking with someone and I knew that what I was saying was correct and they kept saying no, no, this is not correct. I'm not acknowledging that you are correct. As there were words in the last game and the musical instrument game, where I was putting in a word that was clearly a word, and it was not recognized so that was pretty irritating. That's all"
Thoughts,"I guess a similar thing where you're you're saying something or putting something together, that is correct, and it is not being acknowledged as such so you just move on, sometimes to something else. That's it."
Thoughts,"Again on the second game I was having a few instances once again of finding a word that was correct, and it was not showing up and I just decided well, this is part of this test, so I just moved on, instead of trying it multiple times, I tried it a couple times, and if it didn't take, then I just moved on figuring this is part of the test. That's it. "
Thoughts,"I guess when something is working part of the time, and not working, another part of the time I just have to make the decision to move on either to another game or in an instance that is not this, quitting or moving on to something else. That's it."
Thoughts,"The first game is mildly interesting, the second game is more interesting, not only because of words, but of words that fit the category that, for whatever reason don't get acknowledged and so it becomes sort of a test of how."
Thoughts,"Well, I guess the word search just kind of reminds me of getting up and doing the paper every morning."
Thoughts,"The balloon game game is well, I actually just bought a balloon inflator for my grandchildren, so the game kind of reminds me of how long can you hold the balloon on the inflator before it pops. It's a bit of a challenge. "
Thoughts,"Well, I can't really think of a story, I guess, I feel like the word search game it's a very predictable thing, so I mean I guess similar to a predictable job. The balloon game seems to throw a lot of punches. I'm not sure that the capacity of the balloon within a given game and color is always the same."
Thoughts,"So I guess I could equate that to some aspect of life, where you really can't seem to get ahead because the rules don't make a lot of sense. Well, maybe it's like watching the impeachment trial. Everything seems so obvious and yet people don't really buy it or the hearings today."
Thoughts,"Oh it's maybe like playing with my three grandchildren. Each one likes a different type of game. The older one would like the word game. The younger two would definitely like the balloon game and they would probably attempt to pop them every time. Well, right at the moment, my sciatica is flaring up so I guess the same as every other time it flares up it gets a little uncomfortable."
Thoughts,"I guess it's a little bit like trying to catch tadpoles with your hands. As soon as you think you have it, it's gone.The reflection on the water and the movement of the border sort of distort the location of the tadpole. We were splashing around in this little bitty pond, I guess you'd say and trying to catch those tadpoles with our hands and being really frustrated. And, unlike this word game I didn't get a single one. I'm Feelings relaxed. I can't recall anything happening."
Thoughts,"When I was a child, and I would come across crossword puzzle books. They've always been fun. This time it was a little challenging but I always enjoyed these types of puzzles when I was a child, so it reminded me of my childhood. I'm very chill and relaxed. This happens all the time, for me, so the last time would have been I don't know sometime today, I suppose, but I feel very comfortable. I’m engaged and enjoying my time here."
Thoughts,"The balloon game reminds me of throwing darts at the balloon at the fair. Pretty much it takes me back to my childhood and the balloon popping is a sound that I absolutely cannot stand. But I find when the balloon pops, what I don't like it, there's no sound accompanying it and that's fine so it's better that way. The puzzle game it's it's looking for clues it's fun. The balloon game is fast, but the puzzle game, in my opinion, is more fun, so I feel like a kid again having having fun with the puzzles."
Thoughts,"I suppose in some way the balloon popping kind of reminds me Easter egg hunt. I want to go as fast as I can, and get as much as I can at the same time.The puzzles actually take me back to high school when we would be in study hall and we'd hide the crossword puzzle book smaller than most text, in the textbook so the teacher wouldn’t see it, and then we play there. I just remembered that. "
Thoughts,"I can remember playing these types of games back when it seemed like we got more snow in this area, and you were bound to the house and really I mean there wasn't distractions that there are now. My brother and I would have these booklets, I can't remember who made them but, my mom would get them for us. There was always crossword puzzles also, there were more crossword puzzles than word searches. The books that my mom got us were actually these types of puzzles. The diagonal ones seem to be more difficult today for me. The balloon popping is, I blew up a lot of balloons as a child, with air it always bothered me when they pop but with water, it was just all in the fun so. I fell asleep. "
Thoughts,"I'm having trouble finding a story to tell. The last time I had to figure something out. Probably the last time I had to strategize for something, but I can't think of anything."
Thoughts,"I would say, I felt a little hurried, so I would say, when I was trying to get dinner ready for a dinner party and time was running out. Yes. When I was trying to get ready for a dinner party, I felt hurried. Rushed, that’s how I feel now"
Thoughts,"I would say, I felt irritated when it was not working. When I was watching a movie and the cable went out and I couldn't finish the movie."
Thoughts,"I want to say, well, another country with a friend of mine, we made some fish that we had caught and I put the fish villains in the garbage disposal and plugged it."
Thoughts,"And the balloon, I don't know a story like balloons or blowing up balloons, I don't know is that a party on Saturday and there are lots of balloons and they kept flying so that was pretty funny."
Thoughts,"I was thinking about music I play the flute when I was a kid. Right that's it. Music, I like listening to music lot, but that's really not a story it's just a thing."
Thoughts,"And I like plan, well let's see the block thing it is sort of like if it's like a gambling thing I suppose I like gambling meaning in regards to when I used to. "
Thoughts,"And the balloon game, balloons it still reminds me try to blow up a balloon and every time I did it I don't i'm not giving it."
Thoughts,"Well last thing I did was fruit and that reminds me of well, one of the words mango, mango reminds me of trips I took with my best friend Mary. And the balloon thing, blue blue is my favorite color and reminds me of the water."
Thoughts,"I just blew up a bunch of balloons yesterday for the fourth of July, so I think the balloon one just reminded me of me actually blowing up balloons."
Thoughts,"I think it was the last time that I did the word search, the puzzle book and I was in the hospital and I stayed on the puzzle until I found them all. So that's kind of what I was Feelings, remembering at the time."
Thoughts,"The word search game kept on messing up on me, so I would say that it was sometimes like playing solitaire on the computer and you know, whenever the machine messes up on you."
Thoughts,"I think I'm concentrating on the games, a little bit more, so I really don't have a story to share that. reminded me during that play session. Not really. I mean, I was concentrating on the game, not on what I'm Feelings."
Thoughts,"A story. Oh well, I like to do the word search in the paper finding all the different words. Normally I just go through and see what words pop up and see if it matches with the list that they have. So there you go. I don’t know just waiting for something to happen. I guess I just get impatient."
Thoughts,"I don’t know what to say for a story. I, like the word search a lot better. I think I got the balloon figured out now. It's just sort of repetitive doing it. The word search was fun. I’m relaxed. No idea."
Thoughts,"The balloon one's getting to be hectic, to say the least. You know you can go 50 pretty safely on that one, but it’s sort of boring. And word search still fun. So I noticed that some of the words that I’ve seen there are not registering. Even though I'm pretty sure shirt and shorts are articles of clothing. Oh, I don’t know I suppose that I guess i'm thinking about the word search some things that aren't quite working right so that's a little bit annoying."
Thoughts,"to me it seems like it reminds me of... going through a particular [indiscernible] where you’re learning where you’re first learning it, you make mistakes, you repeat the patterns and you’re frustrated when you get to a point you can’t remember the next sequence."
Thoughts,"I would say, first things that comes to mind, is um, just like at school and you’re studying for a test, any test no matter what the subject, and you think you’re doing well, and it comes to being shown new Information that hopefully backs up the old Information and you’re trying to fit it so that for the next upcoming test you’re trying to improve upon the score because you know that the new test is coming up, and it’s gonna reflect all the past Information that, from before like a month or two before."
Thoughts,"And you want to retain as much as possible and you’re wondering how much you need to devote to the new Information that you got at hand versus the old Information um and that you, and the more you’re familiar with the old Information, you may not necessarily have to be that specific, maybe, um. So that you can be free to concentrate on the new stuff"
Thoughts,"I’m not great with computers but um no matter what it is on the screen that you’re looking at, if I’ve done it before, with the computer you feel like you’re on a time limit, and if you don’t exactly make the right connections do the particular task on the screen quickly enough, you think you’re gonna lose what you’re looking for. Or you hit the wrong thing on that particular screen because there’s so much visual stuff on there, everything has a meaning and that’s frustrating. "
Thoughts,"since I don’t use smart devices I have a friend, she has a smart phone, an android, I don’t know what you call it, so I interact with it so I have some, and what’s the name of that uh... Alexa yea? She has that I think that’s what that is, and I’ve been interacting with that"
Thoughts,"I’ve been interacting with that so I’m comfortable with it so um that’s basically my... it kind of helped me with that a machine answering and responding to me and stuff. Other than that, the closest thing is sci-fi movies, I see how they interact with the computers and stuff blah blah blah, so at least I’m not, I’m familiar, just not I just don’t have the practice with it you know, the ease like other people who either own the devices or grew up with"
Thoughts,"you know the younger people, who started talking to these devices that you know respond to them and they know what to expect and stuff"
Thoughts,"So a lot of these devices unless you are a researcher, you doing high level thinking where you have a lot of Information and you trying to be aware of the world and you use that in whatever context, like you said, uh university student or you a professor or something like that. I mean all this new Information all these devices that can help you with that, that’s great. "
Thoughts,"Me? A. I’m retired, I have a lot of interests but I’m from the old school, if I can’t get the Information from the books I have on hand, and the internet I’m more challenged by than anything else so I can’t get everything I want so um, would it help me? Not necessarily, but, that’s another thing."
Thoughts,"It was pretty well actually, I mean for someone to just my first time interacting with it. It seems pretty intuitive like you don’t have to do much you don’t have to ... you can talk straightforward it’s just a matter of getting used to it. You just have to make sure the language you use the words that you choose are you know it seems like it picks up the way you’re talking to it and as long as you understand the basis I guess, uh like I said with instructions and practice it becomes easier to use it becomes more intuitive. You talk to it as though you’re talking to an actual person you know, I know you know the answer no matter me formulating the right question and stuff."
Thoughts,"Yea I thought about that, and I thought you know what the next category might be even more difficult than the one that’s, that’s why I tended to stay on the same one. I tried that strategy that one time and it didn’t necessarily work that well so I though you know what I’ll just stick with what I got. I don’t care if I don’t, I mean ... I just stick to what I got in front of me. "
Thoughts,"And I would say to myself, it’s happening now, now now now, and I would go back down, I think I can ... it’s so weird not to go back to my original strategy. And that’s basically to me that’s how I was doing it"
Thoughts,"Overall to tell you the truth yea, I mean from the first one and I didn’t understand and like I said you had to get used to it and the more I did, the more I played, and the more I thought about it, because what happened is you get into a cycle"
Thoughts,And a lot of folks especially kids they see the bigger these games so they’re used to the quick thinking thing and supposedly that’s how they teach some young recruits in the army and stuff with these games. They’re used to the games and stuff so they um tailor the training to that and those that are used to the arcade games and the first person shoot games and all that role playing games and stuff they already got their minds set up they got that neural connection and stuff so they’re used to that
Thoughts,"Older people like me, you know, we’re used to real life shooting you know not games and stuff or real life situations where we have to respond to you know something like that. So for me I could understand the concept of using games and stuff like that, it’s just, it’s new, like I said I like the newness of it, I like the newness of the tablet that you’re using and stuff."
Thoughts,"That kind of thing, I could get used to seeing myself using something like that. Or incorporating it into either my daily life or maybe not daily but more than I normally would if I had something like that. So um it’s just gives you another way of thinking and uh seeing things and processing ... uh, like I said [indiscernible] as far as I’m concerned but like I said it’s still an active experience so there’s some benefits there."
Thoughts,"I mean it’s one thing to be in a room by yourself and you know that no one knows you’re in the room, then again, put a camera and someone tells you there’s a camera, and it’s observing you that’s stress right there that’s number one right there. And then he can hear what you’re saying that’s stress number two, each additional attention to your conscious aware, take that back, your awareness will increase with each additional, um, something you have to be aware of. And that transacts into stress. And some people, well you handle it in different ways you can be nonchalant about it and say it’s not important but it’s still there."
Thoughts,I suppose I like gambling meaning in regards to when I used to
